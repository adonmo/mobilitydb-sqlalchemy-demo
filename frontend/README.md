This is the frontend part of MobilityDB-SQLAlchemy Demo App. Ideally, it is better to run the complete demo together with backend and the database using docker-compose, as described in the README at the project root level. If you do just want to run the frontend, run `yarn install` followed by `yarn start` from this directory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
